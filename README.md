# Arthur Bates React Portfolio

A portfolio of my projects so far.  I made the basic layout of the portfolio by following a lengthy React tutorial online.  The tutorial ended where the functionality of the website began.  I have spent the past few weeks adding text, thumbnails, and links, original art, and adjusting the desktop to mobile transitions to really make the project my own.  This has been my favorite project so far!
